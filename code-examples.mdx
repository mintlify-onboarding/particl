The Particl API provides programmatic access to Particl's data set, allowing customers to streamline data into their own systems. It's a REST api that allows apps to query company and product level data. 

For quick start examples of how to effectively use Particl's API see below.

Visit [API Reference](/reference) to see all available endpoints.

##### Authentication

The Particl API uses API keys to authenticate requests. API keys are managed in the [My Account page in the Particl App](https://app.particl.com/dashboard/account). Authorization is done through an `Authorization` header.

```
headers = {
    'authorization': '<your-api-token>',
}
```

### Find a Company's ID with Company Search

Particl uses IDs internally to connect all data. Many companies hoping to use the Particl API begin with a list of domains. In order to connect a domain to an ID, you can hit the Company Search endpoint.

```Python Python
import requests
import json

# constants
domain_to_search = "kith.com"
headers = {
    'authorization': '<your-api-token>',
}
params = (
    ('domain', domain_to_search),
)

# make a response
response = requests.get('https://api.particl.com/companies/list', headers=headers, params=params)

# print response
print(json.loads(response.text))
```

This response will have a list of companies matching the domain. 

<Note>
    **API Development in progress**

    We're currently working on the ability to query endpoints by passing in a domain as a parameter, for now we require users to first hit our company search endpoint to collect IDs.

    The reason being domains are not cemented in stone (ie can change over time) and there are issues with uniqueness when you introduce subdomains and localized domains.
