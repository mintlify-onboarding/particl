### Query a Company's sales numbers for a date range

Particl uses IDs internally to connect all data. Find a specific company's id using [Company Search](/reference/company-search). Use that company id to query sales data for a specific date range.

```Python Python
import requests
import json

# constants
headers = {
    'authorization': '<your-api-token>',
}
params = {
    "start_date": "2023-01-16", 
    "end_date": "2023-02-14"
}

company_id = "1111111" # Particl assigned company_id retrieved from company search

response = requests.get(f'https://api.particl.com/companies/{company_id}/sales', params=params, headers=headers)

print(json.loads(response.text))
```
